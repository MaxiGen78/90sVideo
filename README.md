    <p>
        First I'd like to express my gratitude to:
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="http://www.90s90s.de" target="_blank">www.90s90s.de</a></strong> - internet radio for a very great selection of songs.</li>
            <li>
                Alexey "Tyrrrz" Golub for developing and sharing his work - <strong><a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode" target="_blank">YoutubeExplode</a></strong>
                - library that allows the downloading of videos from YouTube.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The original concept of my application was to be able to play a video clip of the song that is being played on <a href="http://www.90s90s.de" target="_blank">www.90s90s.de</a>
        radio as an embedded video. A video should start as soon as the application launched and continue into the next in queue. There should be a list of videos that
        can be re-played and paused on demand.
        <br />
        After trying to implement <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference" target="_blank">YouTube IFrame player</a> and finding that many video clips on
        YouTube are restricted to be played as embedded and the only way to view them is through
        a browser on the YouTube site. I've decided to find a way to download video clips to the computer. Fortunately, "the Wheel" has already been already invented in the form of
        <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode" target="_blank">YoutubeExplode</a>.
        <br />
        Downloading video approach would require to display of download progress and handling files/list entries in case the space on the computer is limited.
